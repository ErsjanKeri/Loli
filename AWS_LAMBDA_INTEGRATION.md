### **Pure Lambda Processing Approach**

The Lambda video processor is designed with a single, clear responsibility: take a generated Manim script and submit it to AWS Lambda for processing. There are no mode selections, no fallback mechanisms, and no complex decision trees.

When a video request comes in, the FastAPI backend generates the script using either Bedrock or ChatGPT-5, then immediately submits that script along with the video ID to an SQS queue. The Lambda function picks up the job, processes the video with Manim and Polly, stores it in S3, and updates DynamoDB with the results.

This approach eliminates all the complexity of managing local processing resources, scaling concerns, and infrastructure maintenance. The system either works (Lambda processes the video) or it doesn't (clear error messages in DynamoDB), with no ambiguous middle states.

## üíª **Implementation Specifications**

### **1. Lambda Function Requirements**

The Lambda function needs to be a completely self-contained video processing environment that can take a Manim script and produce a finished video with voiceover. This means installing all Manim dependencies, Python libraries, LaTeX packages, and FFmpeg within the Lambda environment.

The function receives SQS messages containing the video ID, generated Manim script, and voice configuration. It immediately updates DynamoDB to show processing has started, then creates a temporary working directory for the video generation process.

The Manim script execution happens within this temporary environment, with proper timeout handling since Lambda functions have a 15-minute maximum runtime. If voiceover is requested, the function calls AWS Polly to generate the audio, then integrates it with the Manim video processing.

Once the video is complete, it gets uploaded to S3 with a presigned URL generated for downloading. The DynamoDB record is updated with completion status, download URL, and any relevant metadata about the processing time and costs.

Error handling is crucial - any failures at any step need to be captured and stored in DynamoDB so users can see what went wrong and the system can potentially retry failed jobs.

### **2. AWS Infrastructure Requirements**

The serverless infrastructure needs to be deployed using Infrastructure as Code (SAM templates) to ensure consistency and easy replication. This includes the Lambda function with maximum memory allocation (3008MB) and timeout (15 minutes) to handle video processing workloads.

A Lambda layer is required containing all Manim dependencies, Python packages, LaTeX distributions, and FFmpeg binaries. This layer needs to be built in a Linux environment that matches the Lambda runtime to ensure compatibility.

The SQS queue needs proper visibility timeout settings that exceed the Lambda timeout to prevent duplicate processing. Dead letter queues should be configured for jobs that fail multiple times, allowing for manual investigation and reprocessing.

The S3 bucket requires CORS configuration for web access and appropriate permissions for the Lambda function to upload videos and generate presigned URLs for downloads.

DynamoDB table design should use video_id as the primary key with all job metadata stored as attributes. Consider using TTL for automatic cleanup of old job records to manage costs.

CloudWatch dashboards and alarms should be configured to monitor Lambda execution times, error rates, queue depths, and overall system health for both debugging and demo purposes.

### **3. Lambda Layer Strategy**

The Lambda layer is the most critical component for making Manim work in a serverless environment. It needs to contain all the system-level dependencies that Manim requires, including FFmpeg for video processing, LaTeX for mathematical typesetting, and various graphics libraries.

The layer should be built using a Docker container that matches the Lambda runtime environment exactly. This ensures that all compiled binaries and shared libraries will work correctly when deployed to Lambda.

Key dependencies include the complete Manim Python package, NumPy and SciPy for mathematical operations, Matplotlib for plotting, PIL/Pillow for image processing, and Cairo/Pango for graphics rendering.

**Critical Challenge: Dynamic Dependencies**
AI-generated Manim scripts often import additional packages beyond the base requirements, such as SymPy for symbolic mathematics, Pandas for data manipulation, NetworkX for graph theory, or specialized libraries like manim_physics. Since Lambda layers have size limitations and packages cannot be installed dynamically during execution, this requires careful planning.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Build comprehensive Lambda layers with commonly used scientific packages (SymPy, NetworkX, Pandas)
- Enhance AI prompt engineering to constrain imports to a predefined whitelist
- Implement import validation in the script generation process to catch unsupported dependencies
- Use the existing AI validation step to rewrite scripts that use unavailable packages

The layer needs to be optimized for size since Lambda has storage limitations. This means removing unnecessary files like documentation, test files, and development tools while keeping only the runtime essentials.

Version pinning is crucial to ensure consistent behavior across deployments. The layer should be tested thoroughly with sample Manim scripts to verify that all functionality works correctly in the Lambda environment.

### **4. FastAPI Backend Integration**

The FastAPI backend needs to be modified to work as a pure orchestrator that submits jobs to Lambda rather than processing videos locally. The main video processor class should be replaced with a Lambda submission service that handles SQS messaging and DynamoDB tracking.

When a video request comes in, the FastAPI backend generates the Manim script using the AI models, then immediately creates a job record in DynamoDB and submits the job to the SQS queue. The response to the user indicates that processing has started and provides the video ID for status checking.

Status checking becomes a DynamoDB lookup operation rather than checking local file systems. This allows for real-time status updates as the Lambda function progresses through different stages of video processing.

The backend also needs endpoints for listing all jobs, getting processing statistics, and managing video deletion (which involves both S3 and DynamoDB cleanup).

Error handling should gracefully manage AWS service failures and provide meaningful feedback to users when Lambda processing fails or times out.

### **5. Configuration Requirements**

The application configuration needs to be completely restructured to support pure serverless operation. All AWS service endpoints, credentials, and resource identifiers need to be configurable through environment variables.

Key configuration areas include AWS credentials and region settings, SQS queue URLs for job submission, DynamoDB table names for job tracking, and S3 bucket names for video storage.

Lambda-specific settings like timeout values, memory allocation, and function names should be configurable to allow for different environments (development, staging, production) with potentially different resource limits.

Cost management settings become crucial in a serverless environment where costs are directly tied to usage. Configuration should include daily spending limits, cost per video estimates, and alert thresholds.

All the old local processing configuration (temp directories, concurrent video limits, local timeouts) should be removed since Lambda handles these concerns automatically.

### **6. Local Development Focus**

For hackathon demonstration purposes, the focus should be on getting the application running locally with the enhanced AWS integrations (Bedrock, Polly, ChatGPT-5) while keeping the existing video processing workflow.

The Lambda architecture serves as the technical vision and competitive differentiator for the presentation, but the actual demo can run on the current local infrastructure with the new AI model integrations.

This approach allows for rapid development and reliable demo execution while showcasing the revolutionary serverless architecture concept to judges.
